# Pizza Ordering Application

This project showcases a fully functional pizza ordering application developed using PHP, Laravel, and a MySQL database. As my inaugural project with Laravel, it served as an opportunity to familiarize myself with the framework, specifically in bridging the front-end and back-end database functionalities.

### Features:

**User-Friendly Interface:**

* The front page features a welcoming screen with a straightforward button to initiate a pizza order.

**Order Customization:**

* Users can easily customize their pizza orders by selecting toppings, pizza options, and entering their name.

**Order Completion Message:**

* Upon completing a pizza order, regular users are seamlessly redirected to the home page with a success message indicating the order was received.

**Admin Dashboard:**

* Admin users enjoy a dedicated dashboard where they can view all pizza orders in the queue.

**Detailed Order View:**

* Clicking on a pizza order name reveals a detailed list of toppings and specifications.

**Order Management:**

Admins have the authority to complete or remove orders directly from the database table.

**Versatile Application Use:**

* This application is versatile and could be employed for both pre-orders and deliveries.

### Technology Stack:

**Laravel Framework:**

* Leveraged Laravel/UI through Vue addon for simplified authentication and an efficient creation process.

**Database Security:**

* User passwords are automatically hashed and securely stored in the database.

**Password Recovery:**

* Implemented a hassle-free password recovery feature for users who may forget their credentials.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.
